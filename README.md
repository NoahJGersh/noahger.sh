# NoahGer.sh

Welcome to the source code for `https://noahger.sh/`, my personal website! My main intentions with the site are as follows:
- Provide an easy way to be contacted
- Display my work, along with the source code for any publicly facing projects
- Indulge in my hobby of worldbuilding
- Serve as its own example of my full-stack development experience.

Though things are quite simple now, I am planning quite a few new features:
- Full design revamp
- Functional Vastest Sea section
  - integration with my Go/PostgreSQL API for language information
  - eventual expansion of the front-and-back ends to support additional information, such as...
    - worlds
    - deities
    - species
- Additional portfolio expansion
  - other projects that didn't make the initial cut
  - dedicated pages for major projects, with additional screenshots and/or code snippets
